# SierpinskiTriangleGenerator
Generates Sierpinski Triangles and pyramids iteratively.

Sierpinski Triangles can be generated by an iterative process. First define three points as the boundaries of the triangle. Select a point within the triangle as the current point. Pick a vertex point at random. Plot the midpoint of the line from the current point to the selected vertex. This midpoint becomes the new current point. Repeat this process, randomly selecting a vertex each time.

This same process can be used to generate Sierpinski Pyramids.
